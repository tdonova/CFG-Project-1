            <p>'Making a puzzle is very similar to making a tapestry' - Garo said. - It requires the same amount of patience, vigilance and an eye for detail'. Gavril Donov (Garo) is a 77-year old retired, mathematician and a computer-programmer with a 30+ years of experience in the IT industry from Bulgaria. He is also a professional wall painter and a room decorator. He has always been passionate about colours, patterns and spatial arrangements and that's how he started making large puzzles. </p>
            <p class="dark">He started making puzzles back in the mid-1990s when Ravensburger's puzzles became commercially available in the market. He started working with 1000-pieces puzzles at first, refine his technique and speed, and then he moved to worked with larger puzzles of 1500, 2000 and 3000 pieces. He has completed over 20 puzzles, while living in Bulgaria and now he aims to exceed this target while living in Belfast. Garo is fan of beautiful and colourful vistas and he had previously bought most of his puzzles from the German company Ravensburger, while now, he is buying most of his puzzles from ‘Castorland’, a Polish puzzle company. He discovered it recently and he favours it because of its vivid colours and aesthetic beauty of all of its puzzles types (cottages, seas, buildings, flowers) it offers. </p>

              <h3><strong>Garo's process</strong></h3>
              <p> Garo has also developed strategies over the years after making so many puzzles. He starts by sorting all similarly coloured pieces together and then he proceeds with building the puzzle using a magnifier. First, he makes the outer lines of the puzzle on a special puzzle board and then he makes either parts of the puzzles (if it is larger), or directly works on the entire picture. He can now make smaller puzzles (1000 pieces) in around 2 weeks, the medium sized (2000 pieces) puzzles take about a month, while the larger puzzles take 2-3 months.</p>
